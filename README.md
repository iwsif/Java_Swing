# Java_Swing

**Java Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) widget toolkit that includes a rich set of widgets. 
  It is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and includes several packages for developing rich desktop applications in Java. 
  Swing includes built-in controls such as trees, image buttons, tabbed panes, sliders, toolbars, color choosers, tables, and text areas to display HTTP or rich      text format (RTF). 
  Swing components are written entirely in Java and thus are platform-independent.**
