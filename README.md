# Java_Swing

**Java Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) widget toolkit that includes a rich set of widgets. 
  It is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and includes several packages for developing rich desktop applications in Java. 
  Swing includes built-in controls such as trees, image buttons, tabbed panes, sliders, toolbars, color choosers, tables, and text areas to display HTTP or rich      text format (RTF). 
  Swing components are written entirely in Java and thus are platform-independent.**

**Hashing is the practice of using an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length. This is called a hash value (or sometimes hash code or hash sums or even a hash digest).Whereas encryption is a two-way function, hashing is a one-way function. While it’s technically possible to reverse-hash something, the computing power required makes it unfeasible. Hashing is one-way.
Now, whereas encryption is meant to protect data in transit, hashing is meant to verify that a file or piece of data hasn’t been altered—that it is authentic. In other words, it serves as a check-sum.**
