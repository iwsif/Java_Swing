# Java_Swing

**Swing is a part of Java Foundation classes (JFC), the other parts of JFC are java2D and Abstract window toolkit (AWT). AWT, Swing & Java 2D are used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in java.Swing API is used for building GUIs on the top of AWT and is much more light-weight compared to AWT.**

**WHAT IS HASH?**

**A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.**

**WHAT IS CHF(Cryptographic hash function)?**

**A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size (often called the "message") to a bit array of a fixed size (the "hash value", "hash", or "message digest"). It is a one-way function, that is, a function which is practically infeasible to invert.Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes.Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.**

**Hasher.java**

**Hash your password with SHA-256 hash algorithm.**

**SHA-256 && SHA-512**

**SHA-2 is an algorithm, a generalized idea of how to hash data. SHA-256 sets additional constants that define the SHA-2 algorithm’s behavior. One such constant is the output size. “256” and “512” refer to their respective output digest sizes in bits.**
